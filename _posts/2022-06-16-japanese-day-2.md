## Learnt
* Genki Lesson 2

<ruby>買物<rp>(</rp><rt>かいもの</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>

We went shopping!

When you go shopping you use common words like *how much*, *cheap*, *pricey*, *etc*, Also you learn words like *That, this, where, which*...

We have simple table of these words.

| これ  |  here | この  |  this... | どの  | which  |  どこ | where  |
|  それ |  there |  その | that...  | ここ |  here |  だれ |  who |
|  あれ |  over there |  あの | that...(over there)  |  そこ | there  |  どれ | which one  |
|   |   |   |   | あそこ  | over there  |   |   |

_これ: near me、それ: near the listener、あれ: far from both_

> どれ、is a question, so we **MUST** use が

### Particle も
Basically means too, that's it.

<ruby>僕<rp>(</rp><rt>ぼく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>は<ruby>学生<rp>(</rp><rt>がくせい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>ですよ。

_i'm a student._

あ、<ruby>僕<rp>(</rp><rt>ぼく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>も。

_a!, me too._

Plain and simple.

We need to pay attention, because sometimes we can mess up, for example

>ジョンはアメリカン<ruby>人<rp>(</rp><rt>じん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>です。

> あ、イタリア<ruby>人<rp>(</rp><rt>じん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>も

If John is American, and Italian, you can't say this, because it sounds like you're talking about another person being Italian, and John is Italian too.

We also learnt how to say something is NOT...

$$ (X\;は) ...Y \begin{Bmatrix}
\underline{じゃないです}\\ 
\underline{じゃありません}\\ 
\underline{ではありません}\\
\end{Bmatrix} X\;is\;NOT\;Y.
$$

You have these 3 forms, the first is conservative speech style, second normal i guess, 3rd is formal for writting.

### ~ね、～よ。

These two particles are added at the end of the phrase to give it some kind of emphasis,  depends on the way you speak with the listener.

If you want to ask for comfirmation you add **ね**, something.... **right?**

if you want to say that you are confident on something you add **よ**, *this happened! **i tell you.***

### <ruby>下<rp>(</rp><rt>くだ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>さい、お<ruby>願<rp>(</rp><rt>ねが</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いします、どうぞ。

* ください: Please, a common word to add ad the end. 
* お<ruby>願<rp>(</rp><rt>ねが</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いします: Also means please, but used to request something, mostly used when ordering food or requesting something abstract, like a favour or understanding. Sounds more polite than <ruby>下<rp>(</rp><rt>くだ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>さい。
* どうぞ: You use it when someone request you something and you obligue, very polite.

## TODAI APP Daily Read.

I translated this article.
https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/k10013673811000/k10013673811000.html



## New Objetives

Still strugling with numbers!!! Need to practice more and more.

## Random thoughts

You can't negate certain words like adjetives, for example <ruby>高<rp>(</rp><rt>たか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いですよ `can't be negated as` <ruby>高<rp>(</rp><rt>たか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いじゃないです.

I'm going to change the mimi app for an expanded version of the TODAI app, i'll try to translate what i can from the article using Jishoo dictionary, this way I'll get better at undestanding phrases quickly, *i hope so.*

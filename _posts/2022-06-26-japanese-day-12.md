# 100 Days of Japanese Challenge
This blog is part of my 100 days of Japanese Challenge.

## A change on my studying habits.
My schedule is changing a bit so my free time is a bit weird right now, I didn't have a chance to study today like the rest of the days, because i had free time on random moments of the day.

So i started doing Duolingo in these moments, i totally crushed it up to Unit 2, Intro 3. Didn't go further because of my time.

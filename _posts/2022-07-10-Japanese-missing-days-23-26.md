Hello, sorry i didn't post these days, i need to call in sick for this days... I barely can't read anything. I've been doing Anki and Duolingo but i can't concentrate for 10 minutes.

I did a `COVID` test and was negative, but i'm still feeling really bad... Maybe i'll go extra hard on the next days as i recover...

## Learnt

* Genki Lesson 1.

Usage of です、は、の、か、時...

I cheated and already know about these particles, so I'll try to sum everything here.

> です is used as the verb to (be) For example

* 私はホセです。
	_I **am** Jose_
* 時計です。
  _**it's** a clock_

> は marks the topic we're talking about.

To properly explain this particle we will need a whole book, because it's kind of hard to understand and compare to the particle が, but Tokini Andy did an AWESOME job to make it short and easy to understand [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytjRoTwWnzw)

> の basically means that something belongs to another

* XのY means that Y belongs to X
  僕の時計
  _my clock_
* 武のお母さん
  _Takeshi's mom._

> か basically converts the phrase to a question, added to the end of the question, can also be added in the middle to choose options

* 青いか赤いか
  _blue or red?_

> 時 is the time particle　

* 7時です
* １１時半です
* １８時です。

I told you that I cheated and I tested the Anki deck beforehand, and it was really hard to remember some of the Kanji in the decks.

Some of the harder Kanji were.

* 留学生「りゅうがくせい」―　International Student
* 専攻　「せんこう」―　Major
* 歳　「さい」―　Age, like 12 _years_ old
* 年生　「ねんせい」―　year, like _year in school, 3rd year, 2nd year_
* 電話番号　「でんわばんごう」―　　Phone number, I remembered the first kanji 電 because it means electricity, and many electronic things has this kanji, like 携帯電話 _mobile phone_, in this case 電話 was a mix of electricity (電) and talk, speech (話), meaning cell phone, or just phone, I was dumb enough not to recognize the kanji 番号 that was at the TOP of the book, meaning number. But oh well, now I know.
* 時計　「とけい」―　Clock

Actually this was really easy to understand as it's more or less 3 phrases that even a deaf child can understand. So I'll probably change this resource for another soon.

## New objectives.
I found the numbers extremely hard to remember, even thought I tried over and over, so my next mission is to try and do some exercises on numbers, I will try to do it today.

## Random thoughts.
Since I already know a little bit of Japanese, the first lesson was easy, so I expect it to be easy for the next 2 or 3 lessons, then the real grind begins. Today I'll spend almost all my afternoon on bike and will try to find a good spot to read a few news in TODAI to practice my reading with Furigana.

I thought about adding the kanji in the news to a Anki deck, but since I don't know the real utility of these Kanji in the future I can't be sure that will be helpful.

That's all folks, またね～

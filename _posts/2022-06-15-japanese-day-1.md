## Learnt

* Genki Lesson 1.

Usage of です、は、の、か、<ruby>時<rp>(</rp><rt>とき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>...

I cheated and already know about these particles, so I'll try to sum everything here.

> です is used as the verb to (be) For example

* <ruby>私<rp>(</rp><rt>わたし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>はホセです。
	_I **am** Jose_
* <ruby>時計<rp>(</rp><rt>とけい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>です。
  _**it's** a clock_

> は marks the topic we're talking about.

To properly explain this particle we will need a whole book, because it's kind of hard to understand and compare to the particle が, but Tokini Andy did an AWESOME job to make it short and easy to understand [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytjRoTwWnzw)

> の basically means that something belongs to another

* XのY means that Y belongs to X
  <ruby>僕<rp>(</rp><rt>ぼく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>時計<rp>(</rp><rt>とけい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>
  _my clock_
* <ruby>武<rp>(</rp><rt>たけ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>のお<ruby>母<rp>(</rp><rt>かあ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>さん
  _Takeshi's mom._

> か basically converts the phrase to a question, added to the end of the question, can also be added in the middle to choose options

* <ruby>青<rp>(</rp><rt>あお</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いか<ruby>赤<rp>(</rp><rt>あか</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>いか
  _blue or red?_

> <ruby>時<rp>(</rp><rt>とき</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> is the time particle　

* 7<ruby>時<rp>(</rp><rt>じ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>です
* １１<ruby>時半<rp>(</rp><rt>じはん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>です
* １８<ruby>時<rp>(</rp><rt>じ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>です。

I told you that I cheated and I tested the Anki deck beforehand, and it was really hard to remember some of the Kanji in the decks.

Some of the harder Kanji were.

* <ruby>留学生<rp>(</rp><rt>りゅうがくせい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　International Student
* <ruby>専攻<rp>(</rp><rt>せんこう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　　Major
* <ruby>歳<rp>(</rp><rt>とし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　　Age, like 12 _years_ old
* <ruby>年生<rp>(</rp><rt>ねんせい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　　year, like _year in school, 3rd year, 2nd year_
* <ruby>電話<rp>(</rp><rt>でんわ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>番号<rp>(</rp><rt>ばんごう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　Phone number, I remembered the first kanji <ruby>電<rp>(</rp><rt>でん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> because it means electricity, and many electronic things has this kanji, like <ruby>携帯<rp>(</rp><rt>けいたい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby><ruby>電話<rp>(</rp><rt>でんわ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> _mobile phone_, in this case <ruby>電話<rp>(</rp><rt>でんわ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> was a mix of electricity (<ruby>電<rp>(</rp><rt>でん</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) and talk, speech (<ruby>話<rp>(</rp><rt>ばなし</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>), meaning cell phone, or just phone, I was dumb enough not to recognize the kanji <ruby>番号<rp>(</rp><rt>ばんごう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> that was at the TOP of the book, meaning number. But oh well, now I know.
* <ruby>時計<rp>(</rp><rt>とけい</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>　Clock

Actually this was really easy to understand as it's more or less 3 phrases that even a deaf child can understand. So I'll probably change this resource for another soon.

## New objectives.
I found the numbers extremely hard to remember, even thought I tried over and over, so my next mission is to try and do some exercises on numbers, I will try to do it today.

## Random thoughts.
Since I already know a little bit of Japanese, the first lesson was easy, so I expect it to be easy for the next 2 or 3 lessons, then the real grind begins. Today I'll spend almost all my afternoon on bike and will try to find a good spot to read a few news in TODAI to practice my reading with Furigana.

I thought about adding the kanji in the news to a Anki deck, but since I don't know the real utility of these Kanji in the future I can't be sure that will be helpful.

That's all folks, またね～

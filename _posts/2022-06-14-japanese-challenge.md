# 100 Days of Japanese Challenge

Many bad things happened to me this year so far, and I started to be depressed and procrastinated a LOT, I would use my free time to just read useless stuff, watch videos just so time passes faster and faster, that is a horrible way to use your time…

I wanted to use this free time I had to do something productive, learn skills and basically use it wisely on things that will help me get better personally or help me get a good job.

After being inspired by hundreds of blogs about the 100 days of X, and since currently I have exactly **200 days until new year**. I’ll try to do two challenges, and post about all of it.

_For my first challenge it will be 100 days of Japanese._

## The guidelines for this challenge will be:

-   Studying the mornings, at least 2 hours.
    - Anki (Kanji)
    - Genki (Grammar). Will try 1 Lesson daily, on heavy ones probably 2 days per lesson, so basically i would be able to finish **Genki 1** and **Genki 2** by the end of the challenge. 
-   Read articles on NHK Easy Japanese.
-   Test my knowledge trying to create phrases using what I learned so far.
-   Create a blog daily with everything I learned.
-   I can use anything, and any method to learn.

Everything should take around 2.5 - 3 hours, i'll try to do it from 9AM to 12PM, somedays will take less other will take more.

I’ll try to post a blog post at 1AM every single day with what I learnt, experience and my mood, and maybe some random thoughts at the end…

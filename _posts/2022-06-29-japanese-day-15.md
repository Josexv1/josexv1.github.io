# 100 Days of Japanese Challenge
This blog is part of my 100 days of Japanese Challenge.

# Final studying method?
I think i managed to keep in check what i can do to keep learning without affecting my ability to update the blog.

1. Use Duolingo on free time, around 15-30 minuts.
2. Watch Tokini Andy's videos on Genki, I can't write on my notebook, so i think i can take notes on my phone and write about it when i get home, or expand on Obsidian App.
3. Use [Genki Exercises](https://sethclydesdale.github.io) to practice the lesson Online
4. Use Anki to practice the N5/N4 tango. I set it up to do 15 new cards daily, and review to 99999.
5. Test [The Moe Way](https://learnjapanese.moe/)'s method of learning, which is basically learn the N5/N4 tango, and jump right to read real Japanese, reading novels or playing games to mine phrases and words. I was doing something similar with TODAI App, so i think it will be good.
6. Avoid burnout phase, with simple reviews on some days... When i feel myself low on energy i'll try to do Anki and move on.
7. Stop using romaji, and use Japanese most of the time, and stop translating things on the blog. The objetive is that by more or less day 50, **the blog will be 90%+ Japanese.**

From now on, Japanese only!

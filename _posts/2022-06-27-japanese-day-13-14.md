# More changes on my schedule
Yesterday i talked about my schedule changing, so i need to change a bit more what i can do to keep studying Japanese on my free time.

Right now i'm using Duolingo, TODAI, and I'll start watching [Tokini's Genki 1, 3rd edition playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCzxXKFTYps&list=PLA_RcUI8km1NMhiEebcbqdlcHv_2ngbO2&index=6)

I did a review of Lesson 4 both days, 27-28 of June, and will start Lesson 5 next day, also moved to Obsidian to try and write what i can on my phone.

# 100 Days of Japanese Challenge
This blog is part of my 100 days of Japanese Challenge.

## About the lenght of the blog posts
I found the lenght of the blogs lacking, mostly because i have to study in the mornings, then go to work until midnight, then write the blog at midnight so it will be published at around 1AM or 2AM, as you found out didn't work, mostly because I came home dead tired, so i think it's better if i write a simple blog daily with as much as i can sum, then on mondays update all blogs with the practices, i have to write everything on my notebook so doing it twice is a pain in the ass, but hey, i'm need to do the challenge so here is the deal.

Somedays i'll upload the blogpost a bit late but trust me i did study every single day <3

luv. (^_-)-☆

## Learnt

Continuing with lesson 3.

* Invitations

Basically this word can be translated as, `would you`, ～ませんか。As you can see at the end there is a `か` so it's a question.

〇　昼ご飯を食べませんか。
> `Woulnd't you have dinner with me? ('ω')`　Yep.

〇　テニスをしませんか。
> `Will you play Tenis with me?`

A bit weird but that's the example.

Some adverbs to keep in mind

| 日本語| 英語|
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|
| 全然　「ぜんぜん」　|　never　|
| 余り　「あまり」　|　not often　|
| よく　|　Often　|
| 毎日　「まいにち」　|　every day　|
| 時々　「ときどき」 |　sometimes　|

> As 時々、余り、are negative, you end with ません。
{: .prompt-info }

〇　僕は全然テレビを見ません。
> I never watch TV.

Again this phrase is a bit weird...

〇　武さんは余り勉強しません。
> Takeshi doesn't study very much.

## Another use of は
You can use it as a question. Simple as that.

〇　晩ご飯は？
> What about dinner?

〇　食べません
> Won't eat it.


## TODAI news / Anki
This day didn't have time to read an article, but did the practice, and did my Anki lessons.
